#  Homework 08:  Higher Dimensional Continuous Data

***General instructions for all assignments***: 

+  Use this file as the template for your submission.  Delete the unnecessary text (e.g. this text, the problem statements, etc).  That said, keep the nicely formatted "Problem 1", "Problem 2", "a.", "b.", etc
+  Upload a single `R` Markdown file (named as:  [AndrewID]-HW08.Rmd -- e.g. "sventura-HW08.Rmd") to the Homework 08 submission section on Blackboard.  You do not need to upload the .html file.
+  The instructor and TAs will run your .Rmd file on their computers.  **If your .Rmd file does not knit on our computers, you will be automatically be deducted 10 points.**
+  Your file should contain the code to answer each question in its own code block.  Your code should produce plots/output that will be automatically embedded in the output (.html) file
+  Each answer must be supported by written statements (unless otherwise specified)
+  Include the name of anyone you collaborated with at the top of the assignment
+  Include the style guide you used below under Problem 0

#  Problem 0

**Organization, Themes, and HTML Output**

(5 points)

a.  For all problems in this assignment, organize your output as follows:

+  Organize each part of each problem into its own tab.  For Problems 2 and 3, the organization into tabs is already completed for you, giving you a template that you can use for the subsequent problems.
+  Use code folding for all code.  See [here](http://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/21/rmarkdown-v0-9-5/) for how to do this.
+  Use a floating table of contents.
+  Suppress all warning messages in your output by using `warning = FALSE` and `message = FALSE` in every code block.


b.  For all problems in this assignment, adhere to the following guidelines for your `ggplot` theme and use of color:

+  Do not use the default `ggplot()` color scheme.
+  For any bar chart or histogram, outline the bars (e.g. with `color = "black"`).
+  Do not use both red and green in the same plot, since a large proportion of the population is red-green colorblind.
+  Try to only use three colors (at most) in your themes.  In previous assignments, many students are using different colors for the axes, axis ticks, axis labels, graph titles, grid lines, background, etc.  This is unnecessary and only serves to make your graphs more difficult to read.  Use a more concise color scheme.
+  Make sure you use a white or gray background (preferably light gray if you use gray).
+  Make sure that titles, labels, and axes are in dark colors, so that they contrast well with the light colored background.
+  Only use color when necessary and when it enhances your graph.  For example, if you have a univariate bar chart, there's no need to color the bars different colors, since this is redundant.
+  In general, try to keep your themes (and written answers) professional.  Remember, you should treat these assignments as professional reports.


c.  Treat your submission as a formal report:

+  Use complete sentences when answering questions.  
+  Answer in the context of the problem.  
+  Treat your submission more as a formal "report", where you are providing details analyses to answer the research questions asked in the problems.


d.  What style guide are you using for this assignment?

## e.  

Five variables are included in this graph (if we consider the MDS coordinates as only 2 variables; since each MDS coordinate is some combination of the 4 continuous variables, we could also say 7).  We include the first 2 MDS coordinates, what school level they are in (`StageID`),  their grade/ mark in the class (`Grade`), and a binary variable if their absents were above 7 (`AbsentDays`).

**Takeaway**
We can think about the 2 MDS components as some combination of the number of times the student raised their Hands (`RaisedHands`), times utilized student class resources (`VisitedResources`), number of times they checked new announcements for the class (`AnnouncementsView`), and number of times the student participated in discussion groups (`Discussion`). When visualizing projections of variables with MDS or PCA, we can't really interpret the axes themselves, but we can observe group structure in the data.  With this in mind, we see that there is strong clustering of students with similar class grades/marks.  Especially in the first MDS component direction, we see that low performers tend to have smaller values of this coordinate than average students and much lower than high performing students. This might lead us to assume that this coordinate contains information that is associated with success or ability to do well in classes. Additionally first dimension also allows us to nicely cluster those with more than 7 absences and those with fewer, indicated by the text `A` and `U`.  That is, there are many "A"s on the left-hand side of the graph, and more "U"s on the right-hand side.  These two MDS coordinates didn't seem distinguish much between the School levels of the student,  though it is not easy to see this in the current graph (this is more obvious if you facet by the `StageID`).

**More Text Annotations on Graphs**

Load the Olive Oil data from Lab 08.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
olive <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sventura/315-code-and-datasets/master/data/olive_oil.csv")
```


##  Part (a)

Create a bar chart of the `region` variable.  Use the `geom_text()` function to add the counts in each bar **above** each bar in the bar chart.  E.g., `ggplot(...) + ... + geom_text(stat = "count", aes(y = ..count.., label = ..count..))`.  Adjust the `vjust` parameter in `geom_text()` in order to place the numbers in a more appropriate place.  Use a single non-default color for the bars.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
region.labels <- c("Northern Apulia", "Southern Apulia", "Calabria", "Sicily",
                   "Inland Sardinia", "Coastal Sardinia", "Eastern Liguria",
                   "Western Liguria", "Umbria")
area.labels <- c("South", "Sardinia", "Centre-North")

olive <- olive %>% mutate(region = as.factor(region), area = as.factor(area)) 
levels(olive$region) <- region.labels
levels(olive$area) <- area.labels
olive %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = region)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "#cc002b") +
  ggtitle("Number of Olive Oils per Region") +
  labs(x = "Region", y = "Count") + 
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(y = ..count.., label = ..count.., vjust = -0.4)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

##  Part (b)

Create a bar chart of the `area` variable.  Use the `geom_text()` function to add the counts in each bar **in the middle** of each bar (i..e halfway up each bar) in the bar chart.  Use a larger-than-default font size for the text.  Use a single non-default color for the bars, and change the color of the text so that it contrasts well with the color of the bars.  

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
olive %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "#cc002b") +
  ggtitle("Number of Olive Oils per Area") +
  labs(x = "Area", y = "Count") + 
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(y = ..count.. / 2, label = ..count..),
            size = 10, colour = "#4d565b") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

##  Part (c)

Repeat part (b), but use `label = scales::percent((..count..)/sum(..count..)))` to put percentages on the plot instead of the raw count scale.  This is nice, since it allows you to quickly see both the percentages and the counts (height of the bars) in each category.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
olive %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "#cc002b") +
  ggtitle("Number of Olive Oils per Area") +
  labs(x = "Area", y = "Count") + 
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(y = ..count.. / 2, 
                label = scales::percent((..count..)/sum(..count..))),
            size = 10, colour = "#4d565b") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

       color = "Student Grade / Mark") +
  my_theme
```


##  Part E


I prefer the default bandwidth. The larger bandwidth returns an extremely smooth density estimate that doesn’t provide any useful information about the underlying empirical distribution in this problem. Specifically we are missing the peak/ mode associated with the heavy cluster of High preforming individuals with under 7 days of absences (black `U`s). Generally we see that the clustering of points near to the edges are less likely to given modes, which we want if we have dense group of points in those regions. In general, the peaks of the density estimates should correspond to the actual locations of the points (ideally in areas where there are lots of points), and the valleys in the density estimate should correspond to areas of the feature space where there are few observations. The large bandwidth prevents this from happening.

For the smaller bandwidth, we have too much fluctuation and it is hard to see any true distributional structure. The small bandwidth seems to overfit our data. (If you haven’t learned about overfitting yet, no big deal! You’ll learn this in 36-401 and 36-402.)

##  Part F



```{r}
ggplot(student_mds,aes(x = mds_coordinate_1,
                       y = mds_coordinate_2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Grade, shape = AbsentDays), size = 5, alpha = .7) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Above-7" = "A", "Under-7" = "U"),
                     labels = c("Above 7","Under 7")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colors) +
  geom_density2d(h = c(1.25, 1.5), alpha = .7) + basic_labs +
  labs(subtitle = "bandwidth (1.5,1.25)",
       shape = "Number of Days Absent",
       color = "Student Grade / Mark") +
  my_theme
```

Although I really like the default setting for this dataset, I explored a slightly smaller first coordinate bandwidth, as much of the observable group structure seems to come from the first dimension.  This seems to provide contours that made slightly more sense in that they capture the group structure.

**2D-KDEs with Heat Maps and Three-Color Gradients**

## a.  
(6 points)  

```{r}
 ggplot(student_mds,aes(x = mds_coordinate_1,
                       y = mds_coordinate_2)) +
  stat_density2d(aes(fill = ..density..),
                 h = c(1.25, 1.5), geom = "tile", contour = F) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "black", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint= .03) +
  basic_labs + my_theme
  
```


## b.  
(2 points) 


I chose these colors to highly the areas of low density vs the areas of high density. Additionally, the white threshold gives a nice cutoff the emphasis the low density and high density regions. Additionally, this color contrast highlights the high density regions.

I chose the midpoint parameter to be 0.03. This value is smaller than middle distance between the highest value and lowest value, but it allows the observer to clearly see 3-4 modes on the red and to understand that there is some density mass around 0 of the first coordinate and between -1 and -2 of the second coordinate.

## c.  
(2 points)  


I prefer the contour plot over the heat map because it provides more details that we can use to interpret the data. The heat map is a more general display of areas of higher and lower density, but lacks extensive detail about the underlying empirical distribution. (Note: There’s no “right” answer here, in the sense that a contour plot isn’t always better than a heat map. They just represent the data in different ways.  Our answer here is mostly the personal opinion of the person on the course staff who wrote the solution so this problem.)

(Of course, you can always layer everything onto one plot – a heat map, a contour plot, the points themselves, a regression line, etc – if you think this adds value to the plot.)

#  Problem 5 {.tabset}

**Hierarchical Clustering and Dendrograms**

There are several ways to create dendrograms in `R`.  Regardless of which dendrogram package you use, you'll first need to create the distance matrix corresponding to your dataset, and submit that distance matrix to hierarchical clustering.

## a. 

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
dist_student <- student %>% 
  dplyr::select(RaisedHands, VisitedResources, 
                AnnouncementsView, Discussion) %>%  
  scale() %>% 
  dist()
```

## b. 

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
hc_student_complete <- hclust(dist_student, method = "complete")
hc_student_complete$method
```

The object ``hc_student_complete`` contains information on the merging of clusters at each iteration, the height of each link, the order of observations for plotting, the label of the observations, the function call, the clustering method, and the distance metric. `hc_olive_complete$method` contains the cluster method that has been used in constructing the hierarchical clusters. In this case it is set to the `complete` method.

## c.  

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
plot(hc_student_complete, xlab = "Student", 
     ylab = "Cluster Merge Distance",
     sub = "", 
     main = "Hierarchical Clustering of\n Students using Complete Linkage")
```

`plot()` uses a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical clustering results.


## d. 

The maximum distance at which two observations are linked can be see in the dendrogram by the highest horizontal bar.  This occurs at a height of roughly 6.

## e.  

Of the two groups linked in the final iterations of hierarchical clustering, both clusters seem to have about 50% of the observations.

## f.  

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
labels_complete_2 <- cutree(hc_student_complete, k = 2)
```

`labels_complete_2` is a vector of integers containing 480 elements.  Note that this is the same as the number of students in the data set.


## g.  

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
table(labels_complete_2) / nrow(student)
```

Exactly 50% of the observations are in each of the clusters at the highest split.  (Note:  This is mostly by chance -- it's rare that you'll see a perfect 50-50 split!)

## h.  

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(forcats)
labels_complete_3 <- cutree(hc_student_complete, k = 3)

student_mds <- dist_student %>% 
  cmdscale(k = 2) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(Grade = student$Grade, 
         AbsentDays = student$AbsentDays,
         Labels = labels_complete_3)

colnames(student_mds)[1:2] <- c("mds_coordinate_1", "mds_coordinate_2")
student_mds$Grade <- student_mds$Grade %>%
  fct_recode(Low = "L",
             Medium = "M",
             High = "H") %>% 
  fct_relevel("Low", "Medium", "High")

ggplot(data = student_mds,
       aes(x = mds_coordinate_1, y = mds_coordinate_2,
           color = Grade, label = Labels)) +
  geom_text() +
  labs(title = "2-D MDS Coordinates for Continuous Variables",
       subtitle = "Student Academic Performace Dataset",
       x = "MDS Coordinate 1", 
       y = "MDS Coordinate 2") +
  my_theme
```

Most of the low grade students are in cluster 1, although the reverse is not true. The medium grade students seem to be split relatively evenly amongst all the clusters, while most of the high grade students are in clusters 2 and 3. 

(Note:  It's difficult to read the leaves on this graph because there are so many observations.  This is a downfall of dendrograms, which are easier to understand when you're visualization fewer observations.)

## i.  

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 20}
library(dendextend)

get_colors <- function(x, palette = my_colors) palette[match(x, unique(x))]

#  Problem 6

**Hexagonal Bin Plots**

(1 point each)

Look up at the [documentation on hexagonal bin plots](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_hex.html).

a.  

A Hex-bin plot is very similar to a heat map, since the density of observations in specific areas of the graph of both plots are expressed by a location-specific, color-coded gradient.

The `bins` parameter specifies the number of hexagons across the y and x-axis in the graph. Note: there are 20 hexagons across the x-axis and the y-axis since I set `bins=20`. When the `bins` parameter is increased, the size of the bins becomes smaller and the number of bins increases. When the `bins` parameter is decreased, the size of the bins becomes larger and the number of bins decreases.

In our graph, the bottom left has the highest density of the joint distribution of `RaisedHands` and `AnnouncementsView`. Higher-density areas of the joint distribution should correspond with red-colored hexagons while lower-density areas of the joint distribution should correspond with blue-colored hexagons, according to our color gradient defined in part b.

The following plot shows the success rate of taking shots in the NHL from each position on the ice, binned by general shooting region. Note that the ‘home plate’ area in the middle shows a dramatically higher success probability; this is an area that many analysts describe as the ‘scoring chance’ area.

###  Sam Says

+  Hex-bin plots can be extended so that you can specify both the size of the hexagons (proportional to the frequency of observations in that area) and the color of hexagons (proportional to some other continuous variable for observations in that area).  This idea was championed by Kirk Goldsberry, a cartographer who now works applies statistical analysis and data visualization to basketball.  These are awesome plots.

+  Unfortunately, there is no `ggplot()` implementation for this already.  If anyone wants to design one for course credit or academic credit, please contact Sam!  (Note:  This will not be easy.)

+  Hex-bin plots are nice when you have a very large number of observations.  For smaller datasets like the `student` dataset, they are typically not as useful as contour plots and heat maps, since they require a small number of large bins to get a good picture of the density of observations.

#  Problem 7

(2 points each)

**Criticize the Lab 08 Oral Evaluation Graphic**

On Lab 08, the Oral Evaluation Graphic was something called a "Spider Chart" or "Radar Chart" or "Star Plot".  You can read more about this type of chart [here](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/methods/radar_chart.html).

Critique the chart from the Lab 08 Oral Evaluation:

a.  Describe at least two good qualities of the chart.

We can visualize many continuous variables at once since the circular arrangement allows us to put more information in less space. It is also very easy to compare small number of variables since the variables would be more spread out along its individual axis. 

b.  Describe at least two bad qualities of the chart.

Having multiple polygons in one radar chart makes it hard to read, confusing and too cluttered. Especially if the polygons are filled in, as the top polygon covers all the other polygons underneath it. Also, having too many variables creates too many axes and can also make the chart hard to read and complicated. So it's good practice to keep radar charts simple and limit the number of variables used.

c.  Is there any distortion in radar charts?  If so, explain how.

All axes are arranged radially, with equal distances between each other, while maintaining the same scale between all axes. Therefore, it is unclear to discern the actual quantity of each variable and compare variables with each other. 

Arranging the variables in a different order may affect the size/area of the radar chart. Since each variable value is plotted along its individual axis and all the variables in a dataset and connected together to form a polygon, connecting two adjacent larger quantities would produce a much larger area than connecting one large quanitity to an adjacent smaller quanitity.  Therefore if we re-arrange the variables of a radar chart to assign large quantities together, we would get a chart with larger area, even though they essentially show the same data. 

So, yes, there is distortion for the reasons above.
